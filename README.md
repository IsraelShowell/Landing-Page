# Description:
This is my repository for my new and updated landing page!
I am using a handy HTML template from HTML5 UP! https://html5up.net/ 
This landing page project serves as a way to introduce myself to others, share my interests with them,
and by making changes to the template, it even has allowed me to practice my HTML, CSS, and Javascript! 


This is code from the original version of my landing page I made from scratch:
