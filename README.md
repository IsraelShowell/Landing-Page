# Description:
This is my repository for my new and updated Professional Portfolio!
I am using a handy HTML template from HTML5 UP! https://html5up.net/ <br>
This landing page project serves as a way to introduce myself to others, share my interests with them,
and by making changes to the template, it even has allowed me to practice my HTML, CSS, and Javascript! <br>
