										<h2>A little about me</h2>
										<p style="font-size: 18px;">From the age of 8, I was always fascinated by software, computers, and video games, as such, when I entered university at the 
											age of 16 in Fall 2021, I sought out a computer science degree to fufill my fascination! 
											As of July 25th, I am currently posed to graduate in December 2024 with my bachelor's degree in computer science!</p>
									</header>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p style="font-size: 15px;">
										Throughout my years, I've learned many skills, programming languages and processes, and have had opportunities 
										to expand and further hone my abilites.
										After graduation, I plan to become a software engineer/developer working on the Front, Back, or Full stack of software applications!
										I may decide to obtain my Master's degree in a business or computer science related field as well!	<br/><br/>
										<ul style="font-size: 15px;">
											<li>Collaboration</li>
											<li>Proficiency in Multiple Programing Languages</li>
											<li>Object-Oriented Programming</li>
											<li>Software Development (Full Stack)</li>
											<li>Web and Application Development</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p style="font-size: 15px;">
										To both satisfy my curious and inventive nature and better prepare myself for my career, I like to develop passion projects that have me utilize new and cutting edge technologies, 
										improve my knowledge base, and challenge me to rise to new challenges!...and to new errors...<br/> 
										In this pursuit, I've been able to gather and refine many of my skills through hands-on projects, internships, and confrences! <br/> 
										A few of my skills from my resumes are as follows;
								<ul style="font-size: 15px;">
									<li>Machine Learning/AI</li>
									<li>Computer Software Installation and Configuration</li>
									<li>Troubleshooting</li>
									<li>Design Thinking</li>

							<h2>Passion Projects</h2>
							<p style="font-size: 16px;">
								Working on the Full-Stack is my one of my favorite parts of software engineering, as I am able to see how the 
								Back-End processes data, works with databases, and I can see how the Front-End renders the data to the 
								user in a way that ensures that the user's experience is smooth and pleasant!<br/><br/> Designing the software in my head then on paper,
								creating flowcharts, and making prototypes are some other aspects I enjoy doing!
								<br/><br/>
								As such, the projects I enjoy creating the most fall into the realm of either apps, web applications, games,
								and machine learning/AI enhanced applications!

							<h2>Skills Meet Experiences</h2>
							<p style="font-size: 17px;">
							
								A noteable example of the utilization of my skills comes from my participation in the 2024 Advancing Minorites Interest in Engineering (AMIE) design thinking competition. 
								
								<br/> <br/>My collaboration, presentatin, problem solving, designing, and my understanding and usage of AI were just some of the skills I had honed by developing a solution for AI bias with a team of students for the 2024 AMIE competition! 
								<br/> <br/>After many weeks of researching, designing, and practicing, our team presented on stage at the BEYA confrence where AMIE was being hosted, and we were awarded first place for our efforts!
								<br/><br/>(I was trying out a hat the day we presented at the BEYA confrence the AMIE design competition!)

									<h3>Participation in the 2024 AMIE Design Thinking Competition</h3>
									<p>
										In Spring 2024, I represented UMES in a design thinking competition with a team of 6 other students, and we were awarded first place for our solution! 
										This experience has left a lasting impact on me, and now I integrate design thinking into my software development process more than ever!

									<h3>Volunteering</h3>
									<p>During my time at UMES, I have volunteered as a computer science tutor for grade students from the ages 8 - 17, 
										and other university students! Helping others get into computer science reminds me of my own interest in technology,
										and it fills with joy watching others light up as they explore the same world that captivated me at the age of 8!
